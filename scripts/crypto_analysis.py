🔑 CRYSTALS-KYBER-1024 ANALYSIS
{'=' * 60}
📊 Algorithm: CRYSTALS-Kyber-1024
🏆 NIST Level: 5 (Highest Security)
⚛️  Quantum Security: 256-bit equivalent
🧮 Problem Base: Module Learning With Errors (M-LWE)
📐 Key Size: Public Key ~1568 bytes, Private Key ~3168 bytes
🔒 Security Assumption: Hardness of M-LWE in polynomial rings

QUANTUM RESISTANCE ANALYSIS:
✅ Shor's Algorithm: IMMUNE
   - RSA/ECC vulnerable to polynomial-time quantum factoring
   - Kyber based on lattice problems, NOT integer factorization
   - Quantum computers cannot solve M-LWE efficiently

✅ Grover's Algorithm: RESISTANT  
   - Grover provides √N speedup for search problems
   - 256-bit security reduced to 128-bit against quantum
   - Still computationally infeasible (2^128 operations)

✅ Quantum Fourier Transform: PROTECTED
   - QFT enables period finding in Shor's algorithm
   - Lattice problems have no known periodic structure
   - QFT attacks not applicable to M-LWE

MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION:
🧮 Module-LWE Problem:
   Given: (A, b = As + e) where s is secret, e is small error
   Find: Secret vector s
   Hardness: Believed intractable even for quantum computers

🔢 Security Parameters:
   - Dimension n = 1024 (polynomial degree)
   - Modulus q = 3329 (prime number)
   - Error distribution: Centered binomial
   - Security level: 256-bit post-quantum

🛡️  Quantum Attacks:
   - Grover's algorithm: Only √N speedup (still exponential)
   - Quantum lattice algorithms: No significant advantage
   - Shor's algorithm: Not applicable to lattice problems

SIGNATURE VERIFICATION PROCESS:
1. Parse signature (z, h, c)
2. Compute w' = Az - ct1*2^d  
3. Use hint h to extract high bits of w'
4. Check c = H(M || w1) where w1 = HighBits(w')
5. Verify ||z||∞ < γ1 - β and ||z||1 < γ1
