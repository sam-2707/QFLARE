  - `/ws/dashboard` - For dashboard real-time updates
  - `/ws/clients` - For edge node client connections  
  - `/ws/admin` - For administrative interfaces
  - `/ws` - General purpose endpoint
- **Connection Statistics**: API endpoint to monitor WebSocket health
- **Admin Broadcasting**: Manual event broadcast capability

### 3. FL Controller Integration (`server/fl_core/fl_controller.py`)
- **Real-time Training Updates**: Broadcasts training progress in real-time
- **Status Broadcasting**: Instant FL status updates
- **Progress Tracking**: Live updates during model aggregation
- **Error Notifications**: Immediate error broadcast to connected clients
- **Completion Events**: Training round completion notifications

### 4. Server Integration (`server/main.py`)
- **Router Integration**: WebSocket endpoints added to FastAPI server
- **Startup Configuration**: WebSocket manager initialization
- **CORS Support**: Proper WebSocket CORS handling

### 5. Frontend WebSocket Hook (`frontend/qflare-ui/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`)
- **Generic WebSocket Hook**: Reusable WebSocket connection management
- **Auto-reconnection**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- **Connection Status**: Real-time connection state tracking
- **Message Handling**: JSON message parsing and error handling
- **FL-specific Hook**: Specialized hook for federated learning events

### 6. Test Implementation (`frontend/qflare-ui/src/pages/WebSocketTestPage.tsx`)
- **Working Demo**: Functional WebSocket dashboard for testing
- **Real-time Updates**: Live FL status and training progress
- **Interactive Controls**: Start training and trigger real-time updates
- **Message Display**: Shows received WebSocket messages in real-time

ðŸŽ‰ All WebSocket integration tests passed!
```

### WebSocket Events Supported
- **`fl_status_update`**: FL system status changes
- **`training_progress`**: Real-time training progress
- **`model_aggregation`**: Model aggregation completion
- **`device_status`**: Device connection/disconnection
- **`error_notification`**: System errors and alerts
- **`recent_events`**: Event history for new connections

## ðŸš€ Usage Examples

### 1. Backend Event Broadcasting
```python
from server.websocket.manager import broadcast_training_progress

# Broadcast training progress to dashboard and admin clients
await broadcast_training_progress(round_number=5, {
    "status": "training",
    "global_accuracy": 87.5,
    "participants": 8
})
```

### 2. Frontend WebSocket Connection
```typescript
import { useFLWebSocket } from '../hooks/useWebSocket';

const Dashboard = () => {
  const { 
    isConnected, 
    flStatus, 
    trainingProgress, 
    errorNotification 
  } = useFLWebSocket();

  // Automatically receives real-time updates
  return <div>Status: {flStatus?.status}</div>;
};
```

### 3. WebSocket Client Connection
```javascript
// Connect to dashboard WebSocket
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080/api/ws/dashboard');

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const message = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log('Real-time update:', message.event, message.data);
};
```

## âœ¨ What This Means

### For Users
- **Immediate Feedback**: See training progress in real-time
- **Better UX**: No waiting for page refreshes or polling delays  
- **Live Monitoring**: Watch FL rounds progress as they happen
- **Instant Alerts**: Get notified of errors immediately

### For System Performance
- **Reduced Load**: Eliminates constant HTTP polling
- **Better Scalability**: WebSocket connections are more efficient
- **Real-time Analytics**: Live system monitoring capabilities
