# QFLARE Security Validation Framework

## Theoretical Validation Methods

### 1. Cryptographic Security Proofs
- **Provable Security**: Reduction-based proofs showing QFLARE's security reduces to well-studied hard problems
- **Game-Based Security**: Security definitions using cryptographic games (IND-CPA, IND-CCA2, EU-CMA)
- **Information-Theoretic Analysis**: Entropy calculations and mutual information bounds

### 2. Mathematical Validation Approaches
- **Lattice-Based Security**: Hardness assumptions for CRYSTALS-Kyber and Dilithium
- **Quantum Security Analysis**: Circuit complexity bounds for quantum attacks
- **Privacy Analysis**: Differential privacy bounds and composition theorems

### 3. Empirical Validation Methods
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Cryptographic operation timing analysis
- **Attack Simulation**: Implementing known attacks against classical systems
- **Formal Verification**: Model checking and theorem proving
