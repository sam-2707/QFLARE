# QFLARE: Quantum-Resistant Federated Learning & Authentication for Resilient Edge

QFLARE is a novel framework for performing privacy-preserving machine learning that is secure against both classical and quantum attacks. The system integrates Federated Learning (FL) with a robust, m[...]

## 🚀 Features

- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Uses FrodoKEM-640-AES for quantum-resistant key exchange and Dilithium2 for quantum-resistant digital signatures.
- **Secure Device Enrollment**: One-time token-based enrollment process prevents unauthorized access
- **Trusted Execution Environment**: Secure enclave for model aggregation and poisoning defense
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Challenge-response mechanism for secure session establishment
- **Model Poisoning Defense**: Cosine similarity-based detection of malicious model updates
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against DoS attacks
- **HTTPS Communication**: All server communication uses secure protocols

## 🔐 Security Features
Secure Device Enrollment: A new device can only join the network using a secure, single-use token generated by an administrator. This prevents unauthorized access from the start.

Authenticated Session Establishment: The system uses a challenge-response mechanism with a Post-Quantum KEM to establish a secure session with Perfect Forward Secrecy.

Secure Model Aggregation: All sensitive model aggregation is handled within a simulated Secure Enclave, which isolates the process from the main server and provides a defense against model poisoning attacks.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- liboqs-python (optional, fallback implementations provided)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd QFLARE
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

3. **Start the services**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Generate an enrollment token for a new device:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/generate_token.py --device-id edge_device_001
   ```

5. **Use the token to enroll the new device:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/enroll_device.py --device-id edge_device_001 --enrollment-token <paste_the_token_here>
   ```

6. **Start the edge node application:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up edge_node
   ```

## 📚 Usage

### Server Endpoints

- `GET /` - Main dashboard
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /status` - System status
- `GET /devices` - Device listing
- `POST /api/enroll` - Device enrollment
- `POST /api/challenge` - Session challenge
- `POST /api/submit_model` - Model submission
- `GET /api/global_model` - Global model download
- `GET /api/enclave/status` - Enclave status

### Administrative Scripts

- `scripts/generate_token.py` - Generate enrollment tokens
- `scripts/enroll_device.py` - Enroll devices
- `scripts/federated_start.py` - Orchestrate FL rounds

### Configuration

Edit `config/global_config.yaml` to configure:
- PQC algorithms (FrodoKEM-640-AES, Dilithium2)
- Federated learning parameters
- Server settings

## 🔧 Development

### Local Development Setup

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r server/requirements.txt
   pip install -r edge_node/requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Start server**
   ```bash
   cd server
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Start edge node**
   ```bash
   cd edge_node
   python main.py
   ```

### Testing

```bash
# Run tests
pytest tests/

# Test specific components
pytest tests/test_auth.py
pytest tests/test_fl_training.py
pytest tests/test_key_rotation.py
```

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Production Deployment

1. **Use real hardware TEE**: Replace mock enclave with Intel SGX or similar
2. **Secure key storage**: Use hardware security modules (HSM) for key storage
3. **Network security**: Configure firewalls and VPNs
4. **Certificate management**: Use proper SSL certificates
5. **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring
6. **Backup**: Regular backups of enrollment tokens and device registry

### Security Best Practices

- Rotate enrollment tokens regularly
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use strong random number generation
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular security audits
