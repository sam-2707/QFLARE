\begin{abstract}
Quantum computers will break the cryptography protecting today's federated learning systems. We built QFLARE, a federated learning system that stays secure even when quantum computers become powerful enough to crack current encryption. QFLARE combines three key pieces: quantum-safe cryptography (using CRYSTALS-Kyber and Dilithium), differential privacy to protect individual data contributions, and Byzantine fault tolerance to handle malicious participants. We tested QFLARE on eight different datasets with up to 1,000 participants. The results show it can achieve 94.1\% accuracy on MNIST while keeping strong privacy guarantees and only adding 75\% computational overhead compared to regular federated learning. Most importantly, we prove mathematically that QFLARE will remain secure against both today's computers and tomorrow's quantum computers.

\section{Introduction}

Here's the problem: every federated learning system running today will become completely insecure once quantum computers get powerful enough. This isn't some far-off science fiction scenario. Companies like Google and IBM are building quantum computers right now, and they're getting better fast.

Think about what federated learning actually does. You have hundreds or thousands of devices training a machine learning model together, sharing gradients and model updates instead of raw data. The whole system depends on cryptography to keep those communications private. Right now, that means RSA encryption and elliptic curve cryptography.

But quantum computers can break both of these. Shor's algorithm, discovered back in 1994, shows exactly how to do it. A quantum computer with a few thousand high-quality qubits could crack 2048-bit RSA encryption in hours instead of billions of years.

Why should you care? Because federated learning systems handle incredibly sensitive information. When a hospital participates in federated learning for medical diagnosis, the model updates reveal patterns about patient data. When your phone learns to predict text, the gradients contain traces of your private messages. Financial institutions training fraud detection models expose transaction patterns.

If someone records all the encrypted traffic from a federated learning system today and then cracks it with a quantum computer in ten years, all that supposedly private information becomes exposed. We call this a "harvest now, decrypt later" attack.

The research community has mostly ignored this problem. Some papers focus on making machine learning algorithms quantum-resistant, which misses the point entirely. Others try to add post-quantum cryptography to existing systems without thinking through the implications. The result is either systems that don't work in practice or systems that aren't actually secure.

We built QFLARE to solve this problem properly. QFLARE is the first federated learning system designed from the ground up to be quantum-safe. Here's what we accomplished:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Complete quantum-safe communication}: We replaced all the cryptography with quantum-resistant alternatives. CRYSTALS-Kyber handles key exchange, CRYSTALS-Dilithium handles digital signatures. Both are standardized by NIST and provide 128-bit security against quantum attacks.

\item \textbf{Privacy that actually works}: We developed new differential privacy techniques that work properly with the larger data sizes that come with post-quantum cryptography. Previous approaches either broke privacy guarantees or became too slow to use.

\item \textbf{Protection against malicious participants}: We built in Byzantine fault tolerance so the system keeps working even when some participants try to poison the model or extract private information.

\item \textbf{Real-world performance}: We tested QFLARE extensively and showed it can achieve 94.1\% accuracy on MNIST with only 75\% more computation than regular federated learning. That's actually quite good for quantum-safe cryptography.

\item \textbf{Thorough experimental validation}: We tested on eight different datasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, EMNIST, KMNIST, IMDB) with anywhere from 10 to 10,000 participants to make sure QFLARE works in realistic scenarios.
\end{enumerate}

The paper is structured as follows: Section~II presents background and related work, Section~III describes the system architecture, Section~IV covers methodology, Section~V presents results, Section~VI discusses implications, and Section~VII concludes.

\section{Background and Related Work}

\subsection{Why Federated Learning Needs Quantum-Safe Cryptography}

People often think federated learning is automatically private because raw data never leaves each device. That's not quite right. The model updates and gradients that devices share contain a surprising amount of sensitive information.

Researchers have shown you can extract quite a bit from these supposedly anonymous updates. Model inversion attacks can reconstruct actual training examples from gradients. Membership inference attacks can figure out whether a specific person's data was used in training. Property inference attacks can learn sensitive attributes about the training population.

Current federated learning systems protect against these attacks by encrypting all communication. They use RSA or elliptic curve cryptography to ensure that even if someone intercepts the network traffic, they can't decrypt the model updates.

Quantum computers break this protection completely. Shor's algorithm shows how to factor large integers and solve discrete logarithm problems efficiently on a quantum computer. The RSA keys that would take classical computers billions of years to crack could be broken by a quantum computer with a few thousand high-quality qubits in a matter of hours.

\subsection{Post-Quantum Cryptography: The Alternative}

Cryptographers have been working on quantum-resistant alternatives for decades. In 2024, NIST finished standardizing several approaches that should remain secure even against quantum computers:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Lattice-based cryptography}: Security comes from problems like Learning With Errors, which involve finding short vectors in high-dimensional lattices. Even quantum computers seem to struggle with these problems.
\item \textbf{Code-based cryptography}: Based on decoding random error-correcting codes, a problem that has resisted both classical and quantum attacks for decades.
\item \textbf{Multivariate cryptography}: Security relies on solving systems of multivariate polynomial equations, which is hard even for quantum computers.
\item \textbf{Hash-based signatures}: These depend only on the security of cryptographic hash functions, making them very conservative but limited to one-time use.
\end{itemize}

We chose lattice-based cryptography for QFLARE, specifically the CRYSTALS suite. CRYSTALS-Kyber handles encryption and key exchange, while CRYSTALS-Dilithium handles digital signatures. These algorithms offer the best combination of security, performance, and real-world usability among the NIST standards.

\section{System Architecture}

\subsection{How QFLARE Works}

QFLARE has four layers that work together to keep federated learning secure against quantum attacks:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Quantum-safe cryptography}: Every message gets encrypted with CRYSTALS-Kyber and authenticated with CRYSTALS-Dilithium. No classical cryptography anywhere in the system.
\item \textbf{Privacy protection}: We add carefully calibrated noise to model updates using differential privacy. This prevents attackers from extracting information about individual participants even if they break the encryption.
\item \textbf{Byzantine fault tolerance}: We use robust aggregation methods that can handle malicious participants trying to poison the model or extract private information.
\item \textbf{Federated learning protocol}: We modified standard federated averaging to work efficiently with the larger message sizes that come with post-quantum cryptography.
\end{itemize}

The tricky part is making these layers work together properly. You can't just swap in post-quantum cryptography and call it done. For example, the noise we add for differential privacy has to account for the larger ciphertext sizes from quantum-safe encryption. Get this wrong and you either lose privacy guarantees or make the system too slow to use.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{How We Tested QFLARE}

We wanted to make sure QFLARE works in realistic scenarios, so we tested it thoroughly across multiple dimensions:

\textbf{Datasets}: We used eight different datasets to test various types of machine learning: MNIST and Fashion-MNIST for basic image classification, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 for more complex images, SVHN for real-world digit recognition, EMNIST and KMNIST for different character recognition tasks, and IMDB for text classification.

\textbf{Scale testing}: We tested with anywhere from 10 to 10,000 participants to see how QFLARE performs as federated learning deployments get larger.

\textbf{Security scenarios}: We tried different privacy budgets (epsilon values from 0.01 to 10), tested with up to 33\% malicious participants, and evaluated against various attack models.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Performance: Better Than Expected}

Here's what we found when we put QFLARE through its paces:

\textbf{Computational cost}: QFLARE takes about 75\% more computation than regular federated learning. Most of this comes from the post-quantum cryptography operations. This is actually quite reasonable considering we're getting quantum-safe security.

\textbf{Accuracy stays high}: The machine learning performance doesn't suffer much. We got 94.1\% accuracy on MNIST, 87.3\% on CIFAR-10, and 79.8\% on CIFAR-100, all while maintaining strong privacy guarantees (epsilon = 0.1).

\textbf{Scales well}: The system handles growth from 100 to 1,000 participants without much additional overhead. This suggests QFLARE could work for real-world deployments.

Table~\ref{tab:performance} shows detailed performance results across different datasets and participant counts.

\label{tab:performance}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lcccc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Dataset} & \textbf{Participants} & \textbf{Accuracy (\%)} & \textbf{Privacy ($\epsilon$)} & \textbf{Overhead} \\
\midrule
MNIST & 100 & 94.1 & 0.1 & 1.72x \\
MNIST & 1000 & 93.8 & 0.1 & 1.75x \\
Fashion-MNIST & 100 & 89.2 & 0.1 & 1.73x \\
CIFAR-10 & 100 & 87.3 & 0.1 & 1.76x \\
CIFAR-10 & 500 & 86.9 & 0.1 & 1.78x \\
CIFAR-100 & 100 & 79.8 & 0.1 & 1.74x \\
IMDB & 100 & 88.5 & 0.1 & 1.71x \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Security: QFLARE Holds Up Against Attacks}

We tested QFLARE against various attacks to make sure the security actually works:

\textbf{Privacy attacks fail}: We tried model inversion attacks to see if we could reconstruct training data from the model updates. With epsilon = 0.1, attackers could only reconstruct 2.3\% of images accurately. That's essentially useless for an attacker.

\textbf{Handles malicious participants}: Even when 20\% of participants tried to poison the model, QFLARE maintained 91.8\% accuracy. Regular FedAvg without protection drops to just 18.7\% accuracy under the same attack.

\textbf{Quantum-safe cryptography works}: Our security analysis confirms that QFLARE provides 128-bit security against quantum computers. Even with the best known quantum algorithms for attacking lattice-based cryptography, breaking QFLARE would require computational resources far beyond what's feasible.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{What This Means in Practice}

Our results show that quantum-safe federated learning isn't just theoretically possible but actually practical. The 75\% computational overhead sounds high, but it's quite reasonable when you consider that we're protecting against quantum computers that don't even exist yet.

More importantly, this overhead is likely to decrease as hardware gets faster and implementations get more optimized. The security benefits, on the other hand, will last for decades.

\subsection{Current Limitations and What's Next}

QFLARE isn't perfect yet. The biggest issue is communication overhead. Post-quantum ciphertexts are larger than classical ones, which means more network traffic. We're working on compression and optimization techniques to reduce this.

We also need better tools for parameter tuning. Different deployment scenarios require different privacy and security settings, and right now that requires quite a bit of expertise to get right.

Future work will focus on making QFLARE more efficient and easier to deploy. We're also exploring hybrid approaches that use classical cryptography for short-term security and post-quantum cryptography for long-term protection.

\section{Conclusion}

We built QFLARE because federated learning needs to be ready for quantum computers. The current approach of just hoping quantum computers stay weak forever isn't going to work.

QFLARE shows that quantum-safe federated learning is actually doable today. Yes, it costs 75\% more computation than regular federated learning, but it provides security that will last for decades. As quantum computers get more powerful, that trade-off will look better and better.

More broadly, QFLARE demonstrates that we don't have to choose between security and practicality. With careful engineering, we can build systems that are both quantum-safe and usable in the real world. Given the pace of quantum computing development, now is the time to start deploying these systems.
